Currently I am still exploring what I want to do for my project. I am meeting up with a group of friends going to a Hackathon at RIT in a week or so, and depending on the project that we create there I am thinking of continuing work on that project and adding in more features. Alternatively, I may look for an existing open source project to help work on or extend, but I have not spent a lot of time exploring existing projects to find one that interested me
